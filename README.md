Livable Streets Project: Analyzing Infrastructure and Displacement

This repo shows a set of deliverables for our client, LivableStreets Alliance.\

For this project, our analytical task is to identify if there is a causal relationship between bike infrastructure development and displacement in Boston, Massachusetts. Working with our client, Livable Streets, we considered that displacement is caused by significant changes in a community's race, income, property value, and/or ratio of homeowners to renters. We turned to the United States Census' American Community Survey's Five-Year Estimates to obtain data on these factors leading to displacement. The data we use on bike infrastructure comes from the City of Boston's Boston Bikes Data webpage.\

Project Deliverable 1](https://github.com/tuetkwanwing/Infrastructure-and-Displacement-in-Boston/blob/main/Livable_Streets_Bike_Infrastructure_Displacement_20231128.ipynb)) 
for a Jupyter Notebook that showcases one of the progress deliverables. \
In this notebook, we present our data, conduct preliminary analysis on each variable, answer three key questions, and discuss our project's scope and limitations. The key questions we explore are: \
  (1) Is there correlation between bike lane development and the factors leading to displacement?\
  (2) Do different types of bike lanes yield different effects?\
  (3) What are the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods where bike lanes are built?\\
