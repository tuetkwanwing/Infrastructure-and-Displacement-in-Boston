Project Deliverable 1)
A Jupyter Notebook that showcases one of the progress deliverables. 
In this notebook, we present our data, conduct preliminary analysis on each variable, answer three key questions, and discuss our project's scope and limitations. The key questions we explore are: 
(1) Is there correlation between bike lane development and the factors leading to displacement?
(2) Do different types of bike lanes yield different effects?
(3) What are the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods where bike lanes are built?
